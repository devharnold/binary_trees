# binary_trees

This is a repository which we are working on Binary trees in Data Structures and algorithms
We are to start from the basic concepts in Binary tress, that is creating a Binary tree then 
adding nodes(left and right children)to it and then try and perform some operations on the 
simple binary tree that we would have created.

This thing is not hard therefore it only needs some amount of concentration as we are going to
do the best
